    {"q": "What are controllers in NestJS?", "a": "Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses to the client."},
    {"q": "What are providers in NestJS?", "a": "Providers are services or classes that can be injected using dependency injection."},
    {"q": "What is dependency injection in NestJS?", "a": "A design pattern that allows a class to receive dependencies from external sources rather than creating them."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between @Injectable() and @Controller()?", "a": "@Injectable() marks a class as a provider; @Controller() marks a class as a controller handling routes."},
    {"q": "What is middleware in NestJS?", "a": "Functions that are executed before the route handler, useful for logging, authentication, etc."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between middleware and interceptor?", "a": "Middleware runs before route handlers; interceptors can manipulate requests/responses and run before or after handlers."},
    {"q": "What is an interceptor in NestJS?", "a": "Class annotated with @Injectable() that implements NestInterceptor to bind extra logic to request/response lifecycle."},
    {"q": "What is a pipe in NestJS?", "a": "A class annotated with @Injectable() that implements transformation and validation logic for incoming data."},
    {"q": "What is a guard in NestJS?", "a": "A class implementing CanActivate interface that determines whether a request is allowed to proceed."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between @Get(), @Post(), @Put(), @Delete() decorators?", "a": "They map HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to controller route handlers."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous providers?", "a": "Synchronous providers return immediately; asynchronous providers use async/await or Promises."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between forRoot() and forFeature() in NestJS modules?", "a": "forRoot() configures global module providers; forFeature() registers module-specific providers."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between forwardRef() and normal imports?", "a": "forwardRef() resolves circular dependencies between modules or providers."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between @Body(), @Param(), and @Query()?", "a": "@Body() gets data from request body, @Param() gets route parameters, @Query() gets query parameters."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between class-validator and class-transformer?", "a": "class-validator validates object properties; class-transformer transforms plain objects to class instances."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous pipes?", "a": "Synchronous pipes execute instantly; asynchronous pipes return Promises or Observables."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between HTTP exception and standard exception?", "a": "HTTP exception sends formatted HTTP error responses; standard exception is general JavaScript error."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between @Req() and @Request()?", "a": "Both inject request object; @Req() is alias commonly used for readability."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between @Res() and return statement?", "a": "@Res() gives full control over response object; returning a value lets Nest handle response automatically."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous guards?", "a": "Synchronous guards return boolean; asynchronous guards return Promise<boolean> or Observable<boolean>."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between interceptors and middleware?", "a": "Interceptors can modify responses and exceptions; middleware only runs before route handlers."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between global and scoped providers?", "a": "Global providers are available app-wide; scoped providers are limited to a specific request or module."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between singleton and transient providers?", "a": "Singleton: one instance per app; transient: new instance per injection."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous module initialization?", "a": "Synchronous initialization runs immediately; asynchronous allows async configuration before module is ready."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between @Inject() and constructor injection?", "a": "@Inject() explicitly specifies a provider token; constructor injection lets Nest resolve dependencies automatically."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between Monolithic and Microservice architecture in NestJS?", "a": "Monolithic runs as a single app; microservices run as multiple independent services communicating over network."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between TCP, gRPC, and RabbitMQ in NestJS?", "a": "TCP and gRPC are transport layers for microservices; RabbitMQ is a message broker for async messaging."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between @Injectable() and @Global()?", "a": "@Injectable() registers provider; @Global() makes module providers available globally without import."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous event listeners?", "a": "Synchronous listeners execute immediately; asynchronous listeners execute in event loop without blocking."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between @UseGuards() and app.useGlobalGuards()?", "a": "UseGuards applies guards at controller/route level; useGlobalGuards applies guards globally to all routes."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between @UseInterceptors() and app.useGlobalInterceptors()?", "a": "UseInterceptors applies interceptors at route/controller; useGlobalInterceptors applies globally."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between @Catch() and try/catch?", "a": "@Catch() handles exceptions centrally via Exception Filters; try/catch handles locally."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between Exception Filters and Pipes?", "a": "Filters handle errors; pipes handle validation and transformation."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between @InjectRepository() and TypeORM repository?", "a": "InjectRepository injects repository for a specific entity; TypeORM repository is general repository instance."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between NestJS and Express?", "a": "NestJS is a structured framework built on top of Express with dependency injection, modules, and decorators."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between @UsePipes() and app.useGlobalPipes()?", "a": "UsePipes applies to controller/route; useGlobalPipes applies to all requests globally."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between async/await and Observables in NestJS?", "a": "async/await handles Promises; Observables provide streams of data with reactive operators."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between @MessagePattern() and @EventPattern()?", "a": "MessagePattern handles request-response messages; EventPattern handles one-way event messages."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between NestJS CLI and manual setup?", "a": "CLI scaffolds project structure quickly; manual setup requires configuring modules and dependencies manually."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between forwardRef() and circular dependencies?", "a": "forwardRef() resolves circular dependencies; circular dependencies occur when two providers import each other."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous microservices?", "a": "Synchronous microservices wait for response; asynchronous communicate via events/messages."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between request-scoped and singleton-scoped providers?", "a": "Request-scoped creates new instance per request; singleton-scoped creates one instance for the app lifetime."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between HTTPModule and Axios in NestJS?", "a": "HTTPModule wraps Axios for dependency injection; Axios can be used standalone for HTTP requests."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between NestJS Lifecycle hooks and Angular lifecycle hooks?", "a": "Similar hooks for initialization and destruction; Angular is client-side, NestJS is server-side."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between NestFactory.create() and NestFactory.createMicroservice()?", "a": "create() starts an HTTP server; createMicroservice() starts a microservice transport layer."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between global filters, guards, pipes, and interceptors?", "a": "They apply globally for exceptions, authorization, validation, and request/response manipulation respectively."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between NestJS WebSockets and microservice transport?", "a": "WebSockets provide real-time bidirectional communication; microservice transport is for distributed service communication."},
    {"q": "What is the difference between @SetMetadata() and Reflector in NestJS?", "a": "@SetMetadata sets custom metadata on controllers/routes; Reflector retrieves metadata at runtime."}
